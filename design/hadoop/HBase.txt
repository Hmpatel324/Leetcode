HBase
-----

Type of Storage mainly used for BIG data on HDFS
Used to run analytical queries due to the column oriented storage schema
Not as good as cassandra for a typical application (also uses LSM tree therefore favor writes)


HBase Datamodel
NoSql Wide Key Storage (similar to cassandra)

Architecture:

NameNode:
In memory metadata store
Zookeeper allows for secondary namenodes (Fault Tolerance)
NameNodes send writes to specific RegionNodes

HBaseNode:
Comprised of RegionNode AND DataNode which sit on SAME server

RegionNode:
Contains a LSM Tree (LSM tree keeps growing then flushes ENTIRE in memory to a sorted SSTable file on disk)
RegionNodes push SSTable onto DataNode

DataNode:
Part of HDFS as such when SSTable lands onto DataNode it is replicated to other nodes
replication conducted using replication pipeline (Fault Tolerance)


---

Column Oriented Storage:
On disk all columns next to each other vertically
This allows computation to be much quicker
