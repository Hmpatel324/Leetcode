Flink
------

Stream Messaging CONSUMER framework
----

Flink
- Allows us to guarantee tat each message only affects state ONLY Once
- Flink does this by checkpointing state into object storage 
    - A Job Manager node at certain points sends a BARRIER MESSAGE to the consumer
    - On Barrier message, the consumer snapshots STATE to object store
- This ensures we do not have replace every single message in the event of a fault crashes
- Useful technology for event processing
