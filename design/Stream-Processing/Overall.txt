Stream Processing
-----------------

Allows for reaction to a "event" in realtime
Producer --> (Event) --> Consumer
This does not scale IF Producer-Consumer connect DIRECTLY via tcp connection

---

Event/Message Brokers

Broker sits in between Producers and consumers
This allows for connection between Multiple producers and multiple consumers

---

Use Cases:
- Metric / Logs
- Change data capture
- Event sourcing

----

Message Processing atleast Once

Atleast Once: 
    Broker needs to be FAULT TOLERANT
    Some type of disk persistence if broker computer crashes
    Offer replication if machine not recoverable
    Allow for consumer acknowledgements

Not More than Once for Processing:
    Two phase commit (via a co-ordinator node) OR idempotence (design consumer to not processes repeats ie through some key)
