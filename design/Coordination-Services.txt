Coordination Service
--------------------

A coordination service is a key-based store that allows us to store this data in a reliable way
This tells our applications where replicas are found and other VITAL network information

Built on top of a distributed consensus layer like Raft but the key result is linearizable data
Accomplished through either:
1. Read/Write on leader
2. SYNC keyword to push updates from leader to follower and not to trust reader until you see sync
