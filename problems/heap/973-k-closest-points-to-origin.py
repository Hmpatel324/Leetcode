Difficulty: medium

Problem:
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k,
 return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

Input / Output:
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]

Notes:


Solution Approaches:
use a minheap to track/evict when it goes over
